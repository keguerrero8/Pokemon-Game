Pokemon game made in Python with open ended requirements from Codecademy.

This is one of my first projects utilizing OOP and classes!

This game is a 2 player game run from the terminal

Player can select their pokemon choices at the beginning

Then players can battle and perform 1 of 3 actions: attack opponent, use a potion, or switch out pokemon
  
Known improvements and features to implement:

  	-each time pokemon wins a fight, give them experience
  
  	-each time pokemon reaches certain experience, they can evolve
  
  	-create inheritence classes with more pokemon from the Pokemon class
